# Virtual Galaxy Compute Nodes (VGCN)

This repo contains all of the components required to build the "Virtual Galaxy
Compute Nodes" (VGCN) that make up the HTCondor cloud used in UseGalaxy.eu

Pre-built images are available here: [https://usegalaxy.eu/static/vgcn/](https://usegalaxy.eu/static/vgcn/)

## Features

All in one image, a single image gets you:

- HTCondor
- Pulsar
- NFS
- CVMFS
- Singularity
- Docker

Everything you need to run Galaxy jobs. You can structure this in various ways that meet your needs:

- Like useGalaxy.eu: one VM as the condor master, another N as job runners
- Like EU's remote clusters: one VM as the condor master + pulsar, another as NFS, and the rest as job runners
- For BYOC: A single node that does condor master + pulsar + job execution

## Changelog

## Dependencies

We have listed the versions we use, but other versions may work.

Component                                      | Version
---------------------------------------------- | --------
[Packer](https://www.packer.io/downloads.html) | 1.0.4

## Building This Yourself

All of the images are designed to be as generic as possible so you can use them
as-is. We will provide built images, but if you wish to build them yourself,
you'll simply want to do:

```
make centos-7.x-x86_64/vgcn-bwcloud
```

## Running It

Please see https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/terraform/ for examples of how to launch and configure this.
