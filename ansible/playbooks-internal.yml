# Meta-playbook for internal images that just imports all other playbooks.
# This Meta-playbook is selected when packer finds 'internal' in the group names.
# Requires a --vault-password-file=.vault_password argument in packer.
#
# It defines the order in which playbooks should be run during the provisioning
# step. Each playbook contains plays that only apply to hosts belonging to a
# group with the same name. Therefore, individual playbooks can be turned on
# and off via the "groups" variable defined in "templates/variables.pkr.hcl",
# which can also be overriden form the command line each time packer is
# launched.
